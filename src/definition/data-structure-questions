Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. With the help of data structure, the data items can be traversed easily

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Creation: Creating a data structure according to the requirement. ...
   Insertion: Inserting values into data structure. ...
   Traversal: Visiting each element of the data structure at least once.
   Search: Searching of an element in the given number of elements.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Compiler Design.
   Operating System.
   DBMS.
   Graphics.
   Simulation.
   Numerical Analysis.

what is an Array?
A. Array is a data structure that contains a group of elements

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. An array is a fixed-length data structure.
ArrayList is a variable-length data structure.

what is LinkedList?
A.  linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts,

what is queue?
A.  A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end

what is stack?
A. A stack is a conceptual structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and is based on the principle of last in first out

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO: First in first out
LIFO: Last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
A. Complexity can be constant, logarithmic, linear, n*log(n), quadratic, cubic, exponential, etc.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. The best case of the unsorted array is O(n) while the worst case is also O(n).

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst-case performance is when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.

what is tree in data structure?
A. A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.

what is graph in data structure?
A. A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. Hashtable is synchronized.
HashMap is non-synchronized. It is not thread-safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS: Array
   Network data model: Graph
   Hierarchical data model: Trees

How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap in Java works on hashing principles

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a run-time exception and the compilation is error-free

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Manually.
Arrays.copyOf()
System.arraycopy()
Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts

What is DFS and BFS?
A. BFS stands for Breadth First Search.
DFS stands for Depth First Search

What is Recursion?
A. The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent
 In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. Space Complexity, Time Complexity, O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n2)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
